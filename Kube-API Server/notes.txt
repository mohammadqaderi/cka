Kube-API Server

- is the primary management component in Kubernetes.
- When you run a kubectl command, the kubectl utility is infact reaching
  to the kube-apiserver
- The kube-apiserver first authenticate the request and validates it.
- it then retrieves the data from the ETCD cluster and responds back
  with the requested information

- The kube-apiserver is the only component that interacts directly
  with the etcd datastore.
