- Check the kube-proxy logs to detect the network interface bridge solution.

- If the network addon solution is not installed for ex: weave-net, then install it from the official docs.

- If the kube-proxy is not working check its logs, if the error is related to wrong configuration file, then correct it.
Example of correct configuration file for kube-proxy daemonset is:
spec:
    containers:
    - command:
        - /usr/local/bin/kube-proxy
        - --config=/var/lib/kube-proxy/config.conf
        - --hostname-override=$(NODE_NAME)
