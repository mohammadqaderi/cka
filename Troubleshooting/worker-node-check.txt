- Check the kubelet service:
 service kubelet status


- Check certificates expiration:
 openssl x509 -in /var/lib/kubelet/worker-1.crt -text

- Use Journalctl for logs:
 sudo journalctl -u kubelet


- If you found issue related to expired certificate, edit the kubelet config file under the following path:
  /var/lib/kubelet

edit config.yaml file  - edit x509 path to point to the /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt file


- Sometimes, the kubelet.conf file may be wrong, check the kube-apiserver path and port and make sure that the data is valid.
 - Don't forget to restart the kubelet service after update: systemctl restart kubelet
