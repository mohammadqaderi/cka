Kube Controller Manager

- a controller is a process that continuously monitors the state of various
  components within the system and works towards bringing the whole system
  to the desired functioning state
- For example, the node controller is responsible for monitoring the status
  of the nodes and taking necessary actions to keep the application running.
  -> it does that through the kube-apiserver.
- The node controller checks the status of the nodes every 5 seconds.

- The replication controller is responsible for monitoring the status of
  the replicasets and ensuring that the desired number of pods are
  available at all times within the set.
  -> if a pod dies, it creates another one.
