- When a node goes down, the master node waits up to 5 minutes before considering the node dead.

- pod-eviction-timeout is an option that set on the controller manager with a default value of 5 minutes

- when you drain a node, all the running workloads inside this node will be moved periodically to another node,

- the drained node will be marked as unschedulable meaning that no pods can be scheduled on this node until you specifically
  remove this restriction.

- When you restart the drained node, it'll still be unschedulable, so, you've to uncordon it so that pods can be scheduled
  on it again.

- Cordon command basically marks the node as unschedulable, unlike drain command, it'll not terminate or move the pods
  on an existing node.
