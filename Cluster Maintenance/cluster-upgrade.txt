- None of the kubernetes cluster components versions should be higher than the kube-apiserver version

- Components like controller-manger, kube-scheduler can be at the same version or lower with one version (X-1)

- Components like kubelet, kube-proxy can be at the same version or lower with one or two versions (X-1 or X-2)

- kubectl component can be at the same version or higher/lower unlike other components (X or X-1 X + 1)

- Kubernetes can support up to three minor versions
  - Current version: v1.10
  - Can support v1.10 , v1.11, v1.12
  - in case v1.13 is supported then, (v1.11, v1.12, v1.13) are supported, but (v1.10) is not supported
  - The recommended approach is to upgrade 1 minor version at a time.
  - You start by upgrading the master node then the worker nodes
  - When upgrading the master node, the controlplane components like apiserver, scheduler go down briefly.

- Strategies of upgrading worker nodes:
  - all at once: all the worker nodes with all their applications will go down, and the user will be impacted.
  - upgrade one node at a time: start upgrading first node until it work again, then start upgrading the second node
    until it work again, etc... (no downtime here)
  - add new nodes to the cluster: all the workloads under the old nodes will be moved to the new nodes, and the old nodes
    will be terminated.


- Upgrade kubeadm cluster:
 - upgrade controlplane node:
   -> run apt update
   -> install kubeadm required version: apt-get install kubeadm=1.27.0-00
   -> upgrade kubeadm version: kubeadm upgrade apply v1.27.0
   -> install kubelet required version: apt-get install kubelet=1.27.0-00
   -> sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl
   -> run daemon-reload command and restart the kubelet service:
     systemctl daemon-reload
     systemctl restart kubelet
   -> run kubectl uncordon controlplane

  - upgrade other worker nodes:
    -> ssh NODE_NAME
    -> run apt update
    -> install kubeadm required version: apt-get install kubeadm=1.27.0-00
    -> upgrade kubeadm node: kubeadm upgrade node
    -> install kubelet required version: apt-get install kubelet=1.27.0-00
    -> run daemon-reload command and restart the kubelet service:
      systemctl daemon-reload
      systemctl restart kubelet
    -> run kubectl uncordon NODE_NAME
