- TokenRequest API is more secure than the regular service account tokens

- The default service account for pods in the default namespace is the default service account

- For each namespace a service account is created

- To create a service account token run: kubectl create token TOKEN_NAME

- To change a pod service account, under pod spec, add serviceAccountName and it's value

- The service account is bounded to a RBAC role that specifies the permissions of that service account
