- The pod image is coming from: library/image-name
- by default the image is pulled from: docker.io/library/image-name
- All of our examples, we were using a public images from public docker registry


- When using private registry, we've to set the image path in the image property in pod definition

- The pod can't pull the private image, because we've to login to the private registry account then we can pull the image

- For that, we've to add authentication mechanism to the worker nodes to pull the image
  -> create a secret of type docker-registry named "regcred" with the following data:
    - --docker-server
    - --docker-username
    - --docker-password
    - --docker-email

  -> Under the pod spec, you've to add a property called "imagePullSecrets" of type array with the following data:
   - name: regcred
