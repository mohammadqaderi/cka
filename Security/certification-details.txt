- For each certificates in the kubernetes cluster, we can view their details using openssl command

- command: openssl x509 -in /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.crt -text -noout

- To inspect kubernetes service like etcd.service use the journalctl command
  - journalctl -u etcd.service -l

- You can also use the kubectl command to view the etcd pod logs
  - kubectl logs etcd-master

- In case the kube-apiserver is down, we've to go one level down and inspect the docker container
  - docker ps -a
  - docker logs 31s2

Note: when you investigate the kube-apiserver connection errors, and you see the following error:
  addrConn.createTransport failed to connect to the host:2379 (that's etcd server host)
Then there are issues in the etcd client certificate (mostly its incorrect server/client etcd certificate path).
