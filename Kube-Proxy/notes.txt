Kube Proxy

- kube-proxy is a process that runs on each node in the kubernetes cluster.
- its job is to look for new services and everytime a new service
  is created, it creates the appropriate rules on each node to forward
  traffic to those services to the backend pods.
- One way it does this is using IPTABLES rules.
- in this case, it creates an IP table rule on each node in the cluster
  to forward traffic heading to the IP of the service which is 10.96.0.12
  to the IP of the actual pod which is 10.32.0.15
