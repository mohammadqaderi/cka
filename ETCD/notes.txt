ETCD
- is a distributed reliable key-value store that is simple, secure and fast.
- you can install etcd service and configure it to store data in your
  local machine.

ETCD in Kubernetes
- ETCD datastore stores information regarding the cluster such as the
  nodes, pods, configs, secrets, accounts, roles, bindings and others.

- Any operation runs on the cluster will be stored and retrieved via
  the ETCD Server.

- the --advertise-client-urls is the address on which ETCD listens.
  - it happens to be on the IP of the server and on port 2379 which is
    the default port.

ETCD Commands
Additional information about ETCDCTL Utility ETCDCTL is the CLI tool used to interact with ETCD.ETCDCTL
can interact with ETCD Server using 2 API versions – Version 2 and Version 3.
By default, it’s set to use Version 2. Each version has different sets of commands.

For example, ETCDCTL version 2 supports the following commands:

etcdctl backup
etcdctl cluster-health
etcdctl mk
etcdctl mkdir
etcdctl set

Whereas the commands are different in version 3

etcdctl snapshot save
etcdctl endpoint health
etcdctl get
etcdctl put

To set the right version of API set the environment variable ETCDCTL_API command

export ETCDCTL_API=3

When the API version is not set, it is assumed to be set to version 2.
And version 3 commands listed above don’t work. When API version is set to version 3, version 2 commands listed
above don’t work.

Apart from that, you must also specify the path to certificate files so that ETCDCTL can authenticate to the
ETCD API Server. The certificate files are available in the etcd-master at the following path.
We'll discuss more about certificates in the security section of this course. So don’t worry if this looks complex:

--cacert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt
--cert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt
--key /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key

So for the commands, I showed in the previous video to work you must specify the ETCDCTL API
version and path to certificate files. Below is the final form:

kubectl exec etcd-controlplane -n kube-system -- sh -c "ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl get / --prefix --keys-only --limit=10 --cacert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt --cert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt --key /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key"
