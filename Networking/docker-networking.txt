- Network types in Docker

- None network (The container is not attached to any network)
  docker run nginx --network none

- Host network (The container is available on the host network)

- Bridge network
  - an internal private network is created, which the docker and the containers attach to.
  - The network has an address 172.17.0.0 by default
  - Each device connecting to this network get their own internal private network address

- When docker is installed on the host it creates an internal private network called bridge by default.
  Run docker network ls to view the networks

- Name bridge in the network is the same as docker0

- Whenever a container is created, Docker creates a network namespace for it.

- How does Docker attach the container to the bridge?
  -> it creates a cable (a virtual cable) with two interfaces on each end

- Docker container is not reachable from outside the host network
- For this, we use port mapping to map the private network from
- It'll be available on the host identified by the mapped port
 Example: docker run nginx -p 8080:80
 curl http://192.168.1.10:8080

- Under the hood, Docker uses the NAT gateway port forwarding mechanism to forward the traffic to the destination ip
  iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING --dport 8080 --to-destination 80
