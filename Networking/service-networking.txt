- When a service gets created, Kubernetes assign an ip to it.

- That is configured under kube-apiserver configuration --service-cluster-ip-range

- iptables -L -t nat -> list all rules for services

- cat /var/log/kube-proxy.log -> check added services from kube-proxy

- If you asked what network range are the nodes in the cluster part of:
  run ip addr command and check the eth0 interface

- If you asked what is the range of IP addresses configured for Pods in the cluster:
  - check what is the network plugin used in the cluster (usually it's weave or flannel)
  - get the weave/flannel pods from kube-system namespace and logs their output and search for ipalloc-range value

- If you asked what is the IP range configured for the services within the cluster:
  - run ps aux | grep -i kube-apiserver | grep -i service-cluster-ip-range
  - Or, cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml

- If you asked what type of proxy is the kube-proxy configured to use:
  - logs the kube-proxy pod in kube-system namespace, and you'll find the answer
