- When you create a kubernetes cluster, kubernetes creates a DNS server internally

- When you create a service, kubernetes creates a DNS record in DNS server and assign IP for it
  - Hostname
  - IP address
  - Namespace
  - Type -> default is svc
  - Root -> cluster.local


- For each namespace, DNS server creates a subdomain, for that when you call a service from different namespace:
  curl http://web-service.NAMESPACE_NAME

- All the services are grouped together into another namespace called svc
  curl http://web-service.NAMESPACE_NAME.svc

- All the services and pods are grouped together into a root domain for the cluster which is set to cluster.local

- For pods records, the hostname is the IP address and separated by dashes:
  - Hostname
  - IP address
  - Namespace
  - Type -> default is pod
  - Root -> default is cluster.local

  curl http://10-244-2-5.NAMESPACE_NAME.pod.cluster.local
