- In Multi-cluster kubernetes architecture, if multiple instances runs in parallel they might duplicate actions like:
  - Controller Manager
  - Kube Scheduler
  - Kube-apiserver

- They must not run in parallel

- They run in an active standby mode

- A leader election process is responsible to decide which cluster is active and in standby mode

- For instance, the kube-controller-manager can use the leader election process to become the leader
  kube-controller-manager --leader-elect true \
                          --leader-elect-lease-duration 15s \
                          --leader-elect-renew-deadline 10s \
                          --leader-elect-retry-period 2s



- ETCD
  - is part of the kubernetes master nodes.
  - it's called as a stacked control plan nodes topology.
  - But if one node goes down, both an ETCD member and control plan instance is lost and redundancy is compromised.

  - Another topology where ETCD is separated from the control plan nodes and run on its own set of servers.
  - In case a node goes down will not impact the ETCD cluster and the data is stored.
  - It's harder to setup than the first topology.
