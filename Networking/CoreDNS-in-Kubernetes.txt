- The CoreDNS server is deployed as a pod in the kube-system namespace.

- They are deployed as two pods for redundancy as a part of replicaset

- CoreDNS requires a configuration file, in our case, we used a file name ./Corefile that located under:
  /etc/coredns/Corefile

- In Corefile, there are a set of plugins like errors, health, kubernetes, prometheus, proxy, cache, etc.

- Every record in the CoreDNS server falls under the domain specified in the kubernetes plugin

- The Corefile is passed for each pod as ConfigMap object

- When we deploy the CoreDNS solution, it also creates a service to make it available to others components
  within the cluster named as "kube-dns"
  - The IP address of this service is configured as the nameserver on the Pods in /etc/resolv.conf
