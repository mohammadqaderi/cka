Kubelet

- The kubelet in the kubernetes worker node registers the node with
  the kubernetes cluster.
- When it receives instructions to load a container or a POD on the node,
  it requests the container runtime engine, which may be Docker, to pull
  the required image and run an instance.
- The kubelet then continues to monitor the state of the POD and the
   containers in it and reports to the kube-apiserver on a timely basis.
